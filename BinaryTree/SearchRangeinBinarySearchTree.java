/*
Search Range in Binary Search Tree
Given two values k1 and k2 (where k1 < k2) and a root pointer to a Binary Search Tree. Find all the keys of tree in range k1 to k2. i.e. print all x such that k1<=x<=k2 and x is a key of given BST. Return all the keys in ascending order.
Example
For example, if k1 = 10 and k2 = 22, then your function should print 12, 20 and 22.
          20

       /        \

    8           22

  /     \

4       12
